Our machine learning models for the 2017 Data Science Game

We use a three layer neural network to create a model to predict music listening preferences. The first six columns are release date, platform type, media duration, listen type (whether or not listened to on flow), user gender, and user age. The last column is whether the user skipped a song in the first 30 seconds (0 being skipped, 1 being not skipped).

The accuracy thus far is 66.75%, and remains to be improved.
